# Pi Day Apps
The number pi has been studied for a very long time, yet it still holds some mysteries... For example, while mathematicians believe it is a universal number, they are quite incapable of proving it! Indeed, it is thought to contain any sequence of digits within its decimals: you would just need to go far enough to find it! Without proof of this astonishing result, they can only verify this hypothesis on the 100 trillion decimals calculated in June 2022...

Before being made available online, this interactive experiment was presented in the Pi Room of Palais de la DÃ©couverte in Paris, France. It was created using MATLAB, based on the data from the first 200 million decimals. It allows you to search for any sequence of digits and tells you how many times and where it has been found.

Extensive computer verifications show that all 7-digit sequences appear at least once in the first 200 million decimals of pi. So your birth date is in there (in fact, on average, about 200 times). However, to find your phone number (10 digits) for sure, you would need to go up to 250 billion decimals...
